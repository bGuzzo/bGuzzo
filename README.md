# Hi, I'm Bruno Guzzo 👋

I am a Google Cloud Certified Professional Developer and Software Engineer at Go Reply, where I build scalable cloud-native solutions and implement MLOps pipelines.

I recently completed my **MSc in AI & ML Engineering**. My professional role has expanded to include deploying Generative AI models (Gemini) and building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems on Google Cloud (Vertex AI, Agent Builder).

### 🚀 Key AI & ML Projects

My academic and personal projects demonstrate my hands-on experience in Deep Learning, NLP, and Anomaly Detection:

* **[Italian-LLaMA-Project](https://github.com/bGuzzo/italian-llama-project)**: Fine-tuned the 8B `LLaMAntino-3` model for Italian proficiency using 4-bit quantization and LoRA. This project also included the implementation of a complete RAG chatbot system using LangChain and FAISS.
* **[MSc Thesis: Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/bGuzzo/msc-ai-ml-thesis-anomaly-detection)**: A rigorous experimental analysis of under-sampling techniques (like ENN, NCR, and Tomek Links) to improve the performance and efficiency of Auto-Encoders for semi-supervised anomaly detection.
* **[Transformer-GNN for Link Prediction](https://github.com/bGuzzo/transformer-gnn-link-prediction)**: Designed and built a custom, deep Graph Neural Network (GNN) inspired by the Transformer architecture. The model was trained from scratch on a custom-built 7-million-node dataset (crawled from Wikipedia) for semantic link prediction.
* **[Anomaly-Transformer-Analysis](https://github.com/bGuzzo/anomaly-transformer-analysis)**: A deep-dive implementation and comparative analysis of the "Anomaly Transformer" paper, benchmarking its novel Anomaly-Attention mechanism against standard self-attention for time series anomaly detection.
